# Features
Initial AuSIL files contained entries such as "Gram: jaarlanu (to separate), jaarlani (separated), jaarlanani (was separating), jaarlanana (is separating), jaarlanku (will separate), jaarlanany (separates), jaarlanta (separate!), jaarlanurla (having separated), jaarlantarla"

Each translation has been mapped into corresponding UniMorph features:
V;INF V;PST  V;PST;RPOG   V;PRS;PROG;  V;FUT  V;PRES;3;SG  V;IMP  V.CVB;PST (perfect participle/past adverbal participle)

In addition, each lemma contains inherent features, e.g. jaarlanu   "tv,n,inf.". The features were mapped to LGSPEC (it's not entirely clear how to interpret them):

  dv-LGSPEC01  
  iv-LGSPEC02 (intransitive?)  
  tv-LGSPEC03 (transitive?)  
  mv-LGSPEC04  
  0-LGSPEC05  
  n-LGSPEC06  
  ng-LGSPEC07  
  ny-LGSPEC08  
  rr-LGSPEC09  
  iv and tv-LGSPEC10  
  tv and mv-LGSPEC11  


Some lemmas contain upper case E,J,M,N, they mark dialects:  (E) Eastern, (J) Juwaliny, M (middle), (N) Noonkanbah.

# Notes
Paradigms do not contain auxuliary verb constructions such as 

    pajarrangupila   Vb Aux,sub-dat. they two (did something) for us (me and him/her). Gram: With ind, inten, neg moods Kamparni pajarrangupila. They two cooked it for us (me and him/her). Category: verb aux.
    pajarranya   Vb Aux,sub-obj. We (he/she and I) (did something to) them all. Gram: With ind, inten, neg moods Nyanya pajarranya. We (he/she and I) saw them. 

    pajarranya   Vb Aux,sub-obj. he/she (did something to) us (me and him/her). Gram: With ind, inten, neg moods Nyanya pajarranya. He/she saw us (me and him/her). 
    
It's not clear how to include them without rapid growth of paradigm sizes.
